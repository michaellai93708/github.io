### [CIFAR-100 image recognition project](https://github.com/michaellai93708/cifar100_CNN)

   Image recognition is one of the most critical aspects of machine learning. However, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether we should adopt deep learning or traditional machine learning algorithm. Therefore in this project, the team trained three models using cifar100 to determine if a deep learning algorithm would outperform the conventional machine learning method in a complicated image recognition problem. The three algorithms trained included k nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN model achieved the highest prediction accuracy and had the best overall performance at test time. Showed that for recognizing images in the cifar100 data set, the deep learning algorithm, specifically CNN outperformed the traditional machine learning algorithms.

### [Crawler application](https://github.com/michaellai93708/Crawler_web_app)
  This web-based application was built utilizing Beautifulsoup, Selenium package in Python and the Django framework. The main goal for this project was to create a website that could showcase all news regarding intelligent city construction and an application that could automatically gather government public tendering information regarding intelligent city construction and output the data in Microsoft Excel format. 

## Group Project
### [Substance Abuse Prediction Base on Drug Use and Demographics](https://github.com/michaellai93708/Substance_Abuse_Prediction)
   This group project was part of the statistics course. The project used the National Survey on Drug Use and Health data to predict if a given individual would encounter a substance abuse problem. Due to the heavily imbalanced data, SMOTE was used to balance the data. By using SMOTE, SVM and logistic regression, we managed to reach a recall rate of 70%.



### Currently working on
1.  Building a web-based crypto-currency (Ethereum) wallet.
2.  Personality Type Classification using Recurrent Neural Networks, as part of the Natural Language Processing course.
